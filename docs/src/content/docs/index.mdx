title: Welcome to Treeline
description: Personal finance should be personal.

**Treeline is a personal finance app that runs entirely on your computer.** Your data lives in a single DuckDB file--a standard format you can query, back up, or move however you like. No cloud accounts, no subscriptions.

We built Treeline for people who want to tinker--who want to ask questions of their data that no product manager anticipated. It is a foundation you can build on as your needs evolve.

:::caution[Beta Software]
Treeline is in active development. Expect rough edges and breaking changes.

## Get Started

<div class="sl-link-card-grid">

- **[Installation](/getting-started/installation/)** - Download Treeline for your platform
- **[Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/)** - Import your first transactions
- **[CLI Overview](/cli/)** - Power-user workflows from the terminal
- **[Plugins](/plugins/)** - Extend Treeline with community plugins

</div>

## Core Concepts

**Plugin-based.** Everything beyond the core transaction database is a plugin. Budget tracking, savings goals, subscription management--install what you need, ignore what you do not.

**Query anything.** Treeline includes a built-in SQL query interface. Ask any question you can express in SQL.

**Open source.** The desktop app, core library, CLI, and plugin SDK are all open source. Read the code, contribute, or fork it entirely.
