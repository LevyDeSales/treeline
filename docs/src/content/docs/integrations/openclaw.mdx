OpenClaw is an open-source personal AI assistant that runs locally on your machine. With the Treeline skill, you can query your financial data through natural conversation in your favorite chat apps.

:::caution[Security Note]
This integration sends financial data through external services (chat platforms and LLM providers). Before using it, make sure you understand the [privacy considerations](#privacy-considerations) below and are comfortable with what data is shared.

The existence of a Treeline integration does not mean we've audited or endorsed the security practices of third-party services. You are responsible for evaluating whether these tools meet your security requirements.

## Getting Started

The Treeline skill is available on ClawHub: [zack-schrag/treeline-money](https://www.clawhub.ai/zack-schrag/treeline-money)

You don't need existing financial data to try it out. The skill installs the Treeline CLI automatically, and demo mode gives you sample data to explore right away:

1. Install [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) if you haven't already
2. Add the Treeline skill from ClawHub
3. Ask the agent to enable demo mode — it'll run `tl demo on` and you can start querying immediately

Try questions like "What's my net worth?", "How much did I spend on groceries?", or "Am I over budget?"

## Connecting Your Real Data

When you're ready to use your own financial data, connect a data source using the Treeline desktop app or CLI:

- **Bank Sync** — Automatic transaction sync from your bank. See the [Bank Sync guide](/integrations/bank-sync/) to set up SimpleFIN (US & Canada, $1.50/month) or Lunch Flow (global, ~$3/month).
- **CSV Import** — Free, works with any bank. See the [CSV Import guide](/integrations/csv-import/).
- **Desktop App** — Download from [treeline.money/download](https://treeline.money/download) for a visual way to import data and manage settings.

Once your data is in Treeline, the skill will start querying it automatically.

## Privacy Considerations

Understanding what data goes where:

**Your Treeline database stays local**: The Treeline skill reads directly from your local database file. Your raw financial data (transactions, accounts, balances) is not uploaded to any server.

**Chat messages go through external platforms**: When you use Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, or other chat apps, your messages travel through those platforms' servers. This includes your financial questions like "How much did I spend on groceries?"

**LLM providers see your queries**: When using cloud-based LLMs (Claude, OpenAI), your questions are sent to those providers for processing. The skill queries your local database and includes relevant financial context in the prompt sent to the LLM.

**What this means in practice**:
- The chat platform sees: Your message text
- The LLM provider sees: Your question plus formatted query results (e.g., "User asked about grocery spending. Results: $342.50 this month")
- Neither sees: Your full database, account numbers, or data you didn't ask about

**For maximum privacy**: OpenClaw supports local LLMs, which keeps everything on your machine. Responses may be slower and less accurate than cloud models.

**Open source**: Both OpenClaw and the Treeline skill are open source. You can audit exactly what data is sent where.
