title: Bank Sync
description: Automatic transaction sync with SimpleFIN or Lunch Flow.
---

Treeline supports automatic bank sync through two third-party services. Both are paid subscriptions that you manage separately from Treeline.

| Service | Coverage | Price | Best For |
|---------|----------|-------|----------|
| [SimpleFIN](https://beta-bridge.simplefin.org/) | US & Canada | $1.50/month | US/Canada users |
| [Lunch Flow](https://www.lunchflow.app/?atp=treeline) | Global | ~$3/month | US, Canada, Brazil, EU, UK, Asia |

Both services are read-only. They cannot move money or make changes to your accounts.

## Setup

### SimpleFIN

1. Create an account at [beta-bridge.simplefin.org](https://beta-bridge.simplefin.org/)
2. Connect your bank accounts through their interface
3. Create a new connection for Treeline and copy the setup token
4. In Treeline: **Settings > Integrations > Add SimpleFIN**, paste the token

Or via CLI:

```bash
tl setup simplefin <your-setup-token>
```

### Lunch Flow

1. Create an account at [lunchflow.app](https://www.lunchflow.app/?atp=treeline)
2. Connect your bank accounts
3. Go to Destinations, create an API destination, and copy the API key
4. In Treeline: **Settings > Integrations > Add Lunch Flow**, paste the key

Or via CLI:

```bash
tl setup lunchflow <your-api-key>
```

## Syncing

After setup, click the sync button in the header or run:

```bash
tl sync
```

**First sync** pulls 90 days of history (SimpleFIN) or all available history (Lunch Flow).

**Future syncs** pull recent transactions with overlap to avoid gaps. Treeline deduplicates automatically - your edits (tags, descriptions) are preserved.

## Account Mapping

After your first sync, Treeline shows all discovered accounts. You can:

- **Map** a synced account to an existing Treeline account
- **Create** a new account automatically
- **Exclude** accounts you don't want to track
- **Balances only** - sync balance but skip transactions (useful for investment accounts)

These settings persist between syncs.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication errors (401, 403)

Your credentials may have expired. Log into your provider's dashboard, verify bank connections are active, and generate a new token/key if needed.

### Payment required (402)

Your subscription needs renewal. Check your billing in the provider's dashboard.

### Missing transactions

Banks vary in reporting speed. Some update in real-time, others batch overnight. Wait 24-48 hours and sync again.

### Removing an integration

```bash
tl setup remove simplefin
tl setup remove lunchflow
```

Your transaction history stays in Treeline. Manage your subscription at the provider's site.
