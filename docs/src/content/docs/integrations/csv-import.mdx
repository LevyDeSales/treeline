CSV import works with any bank. Download a statement, import it, and Treeline handles the rest.

## Quick Start

1. Download a CSV from your bank's website
2. In Treeline, select the account to import into
3. Click **Import** and select your file
4. Map columns if needed (usually auto-detected)
5. Preview and confirm

Treeline deduplicates automatically, so you can safely re-import overlapping date ranges.

## Column Mapping

Treeline auto-detects common column names. If detection fails, map manually:

**Required:**
- **Date** - Transaction date
- **Amount** - Single column with positive/negative values, OR separate Debit/Credit columns

**Optional:**
- **Description** - Transaction details (may be called Memo, Payee, or Details)
- **Balance** - Running balance (creates balance snapshots)

## Sign Handling

Banks export amounts differently. Two options fix common issues:

**Flip signs** - Enable when charges appear as positive (common with credit cards like Amex, Discover). Reverses all signs.

**Negate debits** - Enable when using separate Debit/Credit columns with unsigned values (common with Bank of America, Capital One).

## Number Formats

Select your region's format if amounts look wrong:

- **US**: `1,234.56` (comma thousands, period decimal)
- **EU**: `1.234,56` (period thousands, comma decimal)

## Import Profiles

Save your settings for repeat imports:

1. Complete a successful import
2. Enter a profile name (e.g., `chase-checking`)
3. Save

Next time, select the profile to auto-apply column mappings and settings.

## Troubleshooting

**Wrong sign direction** - Try "Flip signs"

**Amounts look wrong** - Check number format (US vs EU)

**Description is blank** - Map a different column (Memo, Payee, Details)

**Duplicates appearing** - Check if your CSV has actual duplicate rows, or if amounts differ slightly due to rounding
