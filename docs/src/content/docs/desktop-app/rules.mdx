title: Auto-Tag Rules
description: Automate transaction categorization with pattern-matching rules.
---

Rules automatically tag transactions during import and sync. Once you create a rule for "Starbucks" transactions, every future coffee purchase is tagged automatically.

## Creating Rules

The fastest way: tag 3+ similar transactions, then click **Save as Rule** in the toast notification.

Or press `Shift+R` on any transaction to create a rule from its pattern.

## Match Modes

**Simple mode** matches against description text:

| Type | Example | Matches |
|------|---------|---------|
| Contains | `starbucks` | "STARBUCKS #1234", "STARBUCKS COFFEE" |
| Starts with | `AMZN` | "AMZN MARKETPLACE", "AMZN DIGITAL" |
| Regex | `coffee\|starbucks` | "COFFEE HOUSE", "STARBUCKS" |

All matches are case-insensitive.

**SQL mode** gives full control:

```sql
description ILIKE '%grocery%' AND amount < -20
```

Available columns: `description`, `amount`, `account_name`, `transaction_date`

## Applying to Existing Transactions

Rules only apply to future imports by default. Check **Apply to existing transactions** when creating a rule to retroactively tag matches.

## Managing Rules

Open the Rules modal from the Transactions view overflow menu. Rules can be toggled on/off, edited, or deleted. The live preview shows matching transactions as you type.
