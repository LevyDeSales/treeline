The Transactions view is designed for fast tagging. Press `u` to show only untagged transactions, then use number keys to apply tags from the suggestions sidebar.

## Core Workflow

1. Press `u` to filter to untagged transactions
2. The sidebar shows tag suggestions (pinned tags first, then AI suggestions)
3. Press `1-9` to apply a suggested tag
4. Press `n` to jump to the next untagged transaction
5. Repeat until done

The header shows your progress: "12 / 847 tagged".

## Multi-Select

Select multiple transactions to tag them all at once:

1. Press `Space` to select and move down (or `x` to select without moving)
2. Press a number key to apply a tag to all selected
3. Press `Escape` to clear selection

Selection stats appear at the bottom: count, sum, average, min, max.

## Inline Tag Editor

Press `t` to type tags directly. Separate multiple tags with commas. Tab completion works for existing tags.

## Split Transactions

Right-click a transaction and select **Split** to divide it across multiple tags with different amounts. Useful for receipts that span categories.

## Creating Rules

After tagging 3+ similar transactions, a toast prompts you to save as a rule. Or press `Shift+R` on any transaction to create a rule from its pattern.
