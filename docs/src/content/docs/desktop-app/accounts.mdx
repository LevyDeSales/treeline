description: Track balances and net worth.

The Accounts view displays all accounts grouped by Assets and Liabilities. Select an account to see its balance history chart and snapshots.

## Assets vs Liabilities

**Assets** (checking, savings, investments) have positive balances. **Liabilities** (credit cards, loans) are stored as negative values internally but displayed as positive for readability. Your **net worth** is assets minus liabilities.

For liability accounts, the chart inverts trend colors: decreasing balances are good (paying down debt).

## Balance Snapshots

Snapshots record your balance at a point in time. They're created:
- Automatically during bank sync
- Manually via **+ Add Balance** (`s`)
- When recalculating from transactions

## Recalculating Balances

If your balance history seems off, you can recompute it from transactions:

1. Select the account and press `r`
2. Enter a known starting balance and date
3. Treeline computes daily balances forward from that point

This replaces existing snapshots.

## Deleting an Account

Deleting an account (`d`) also deletes all its transactions and snapshots. This cannot be undone.
