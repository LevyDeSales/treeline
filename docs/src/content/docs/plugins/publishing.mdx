Once your plugin is working, you can share it with others by publishing to GitHub and adding it to the plugin registry.

## Preparing for Release

Before publishing, verify your plugin is ready:

### 1. Update manifest.json

Ensure all fields are accurate:

```json
{
  "id": "my-plugin",
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Clear, concise description of what it does",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "main": "index.js",
  "permissions": {
    "read": ["transactions", "accounts"],
    "schemaName": "plugin_my_plugin"
  }
}
```

### 2. Test Thoroughly

- Build the plugin: `npm run build`
- Install locally: `tl plugin install .`
- Test all features in the desktop app
- Verify it works with both light and dark themes
- Test with real data (not just demo mode)

### 3. Clean Up

- Remove debug `console.log()` statements
- Handle errors gracefully with `sdk.toast.error()`
- Ensure subscriptions are cleaned up in `onDestroy()`

## Releasing a Version

The template includes automation for releasing. When you push a tag, GitHub Actions builds and publishes your plugin.

### Using the Release Script

```bash
./scripts/release.sh 0.1.0
```

This script:

1. Updates the version in `manifest.json`
2. Builds the plugin
3. Commits the version bump
4. Creates a git tag
5. Pushes to GitHub

The GitHub Actions workflow then:

1. Checks out the code
2. Installs dependencies
3. Builds the plugin
4. Creates a GitHub release with `manifest.json` and `dist/index.js`

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning

Follow [semver](https://semver.org/) for version numbers:

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0) - Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (0.1.0) - New features, backwards compatible
- **PATCH** (0.0.1) - Bug fixes

### Version Consistency

Keep versions in sync across:

- `manifest.json` - `version` field
- `package.json` - `version` field (optional but recommended)
- Git tags - `v0.1.0` format

## Adding to the Plugin Registry

Once you have a GitHub release, submit your plugin to the plugin registry.

### 1. Fork the Treeline Repository

Fork [treeline-money/treeline](https://github.com/treeline-money/treeline) on GitHub.

### 2. Edit plugins.json

Add your plugin to `plugins.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "my-plugin",
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "description": "Clear description of what it does",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "repo": "https://github.com/yourusername/my-plugin"
}
```

**Fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Must match your manifest.json |
| `name` | Yes | Display name |
| `description` | Yes | Brief description (under 100 chars) |
| `author` | Yes | Your name or organization |
| `repo` | Yes | GitHub repository URL |
| `featured` | No | Set by maintainers only |

### 3. Submit a Pull Request

Create a PR with:

- Title: `Add [plugin-name] plugin`
- Description: Brief explanation of what your plugin does
- Link to your repository

### 4. Review Process

Maintainers will review your PR for:

- Working GitHub release
- Accurate manifest.json
- Reasonable permissions (not requesting more than needed)
- No malicious code

## Plugin Guidelines

### Do

- Make plugins that solve real problems
- Document your plugin's features
- Respond to issues and PRs
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Test with the latest Treeline version

### Don't

- Request unnecessary permissions
- Include tracking or analytics
- Bundle large dependencies
- Copy other plugins without attribution
- Include offensive content

### Security

- Never log or transmit user financial data
- Only access tables declared in permissions
- Don't make network requests without user consent

## Updating Your Plugin

When you release a new version:

1. Update `manifest.json` with the new version
2. Run `./scripts/release.sh <version>`
3. The new version appears automatically for users

The registry pulls from your latest GitHub release. No PR needed for updates.

## Support

If you need help:

- Check existing plugins for examples
- Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/EcNvBnSft5) and post in #feedback
- [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/treeline-money/treeline/issues) for bugs

## PLUGIN_PREVIEW.md

All plugins should include a `PLUGIN_PREVIEW.md` file in their GitHub repository. This file is used to display plugin information on the [treeline.money](https://treeline.money) landing page and in the desktop app's plugin browser.

See these plugins for examples of how to structure your PLUGIN_PREVIEW.md:

- [plugin-budget](https://github.com/treeline-money/plugin-budget)
- [plugin-goals](https://github.com/treeline-money/plugin-goals)
