Treeline is open source and we'd love your help.

## Build a Plugin

The best way to contribute is to **build a plugin**. Plugins extend Treeline without touching core code - if you have an idea for something Treeline doesn't do yet, a plugin is the way to make it happen.

See [Creating Plugins](/plugins/creating-plugins) to get started. When your plugin is ready, open a PR to add it to `plugins.json` and we'll add it to the community catalog.

## Other Ways to Help

- **Report bugs** - [Open an issue](https://github.com/treeline-money/treeline/issues) when something breaks
- **Fix bugs** - Browse issues and submit a PR
- **Improve docs** - Typos, unclear explanations, missing examples
- **Answer questions** - Help others in [Discord](https://discord.gg/EcNvBnSft5)

## Development Setup

Want to work on the desktop app, CLI, or core library? Here's how to get running.

### Prerequisites

**Rust** - Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

**Node.js 18+** - We recommend [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm):

```bash
fnm install 20
fnm use 20
```

**Platform dependencies:**

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="macOS">
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential curl wget file libssl-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    Install [Visual Studio C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Clone and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/treeline-money/treeline.git
cd treeline/desktop
npm install
npm run tauri:dev
```

That's it. The app starts with hot reloading - frontend changes reload automatically, backend changes need a restart.

To build the CLI instead:

```bash
cd treeline
cargo build --release
./target/release/tl --version
```

### Tips

**Isolate dev data** - Keep your real data safe by using a separate directory:

```bash
export TREELINE_DIR=~/.treeline-dev
```

**Demo mode** - Test with sample data:

```bash
./target/release/tl demo on
```

**Run tests:**

```bash
cargo test
```
