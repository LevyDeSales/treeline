This guide walks you through Treeline's core features. By the end, you'll understand how accounts, transactions, and queries work together.

## The Desktop App

Treeline has three main views in the sidebar:

- **Accounts** - View all your accounts and balances. Click an account to see its transactions.
- **Transactions** - Search and filter across all transactions. This is where you categorize with tags.
- **Query** - Write SQL queries against your DuckDB database for custom analysis.

## Demo Mode

Want to explore without importing real data? Enable demo mode in **Settings > Integrations > Demo Mode**. This generates realistic sample transactions so you can experiment freely. Your real data (if any) remains untouched in a separate database.

## Tagging Transactions

Tags categorize your transactions. Unlike rigid categories, a transaction can have multiple tags.

**To tag transactions:**
1. Select transactions in the Transactions view
2. Press `t` or click the tag icon
3. Type a tag name and press Enter

Tags are created on-the-fly - no need to define them first.

**Auto-tagging:** Right-click a transaction and choose "Create rule from..." to automatically tag similar transactions in the future.
