Treeline supports CSV import (works with any bank) and automatic bank sync for supported institutions.

## CSV Import

Most banks let you download transaction history as CSV files.

### Desktop App

1. Download a CSV from your bank's website
2. Drag the file onto Treeline, or click **Import** in the toolbar
3. Select the target account (or create a new one)
4. Verify the column mappings and click **Import**

### CLI

```bash
tl import bank_export.csv --account "Checking"
```

Preview first with `--dry-run`, use `--json` for scripted workflows. See the full [CLI reference](/cli/) for all flags.

Treeline auto-detects common column names like `date`, `amount`, `description`, `debit`, `credit`. If your CSV uses different names, you can map them manually in the desktop app or override them with CLI flags like `--date-column`, `--amount-column`, etc.

### Common Adjustments

- **Split debit/credit columns:** Toggle "Use debit/credit" if your bank exports separate columns instead of a single amount
- **Flip signs:** Enable if charges show as positive (common with credit cards)
- **Number format:** Switch between US (1,234.56) and EU (1.234,56) formatting

### Import Profiles

Save your settings as a profile (e.g., `chase`, `amex`) to reuse them for future imports to the same account.

### Deduplication

Treeline automatically skips duplicate transactions when you re-import overlapping date ranges.

## Bank Sync

For automatic transaction syncing, see [Bank Sync](/integrations/bank-sync/) to set up SimpleFIN or Lunch Flow.

**Tip:** Set up bank sync first, then use CSV import for historical transactions from before your sync start date. There's no deduplication between bank sync and CSV imports.

## Manual Entry

For cash transactions or one-offs, navigate to an account and click **Add Transaction**.
