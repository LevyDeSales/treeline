Treeline runs entirely on your machine. There are no accounts to create, no servers to connect to, and no data leaving your computer. Choose your installation method below.

## Desktop App

The desktop app provides a visual interface for managing your finances, running queries, and installing plugins.

### Download

Visit [treeline.money/download](https://treeline.money/download) to download the installer for your platform:

- **macOS** - `.dmg` for Apple Silicon and Intel
- **Windows** - `.exe` installer
- **Linux** - `.AppImage`

After installing, launch Treeline from your Applications folder (macOS), Start menu (Windows), or application launcher (Linux).

On first launch, Treeline creates a data directory at `~/.treeline/` for your database and settings. No internet connection is required.

## CLI Installation

The `tl` command-line tool lets you manage accounts, import data, query transactions, and automate workflows from your terminal.

### macOS and Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://treeline.money/install.sh | sh
```

This installs `tl` to `~/.treeline/bin/` and adds it to your PATH. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`) after installation.

### Windows

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
irm https://treeline.money/install.ps1 | iex
```

This installs `tl.exe` to `~/.treeline/bin/` and adds it to your PATH. Restart your terminal after installation.

### Verify Installation

```bash
tl --version
```

You should see output like:

```
tl 26.1.3001
```
